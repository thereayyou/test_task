  "descriptionPartOne": "The article is intended both for those who plan to run their very first marathon, for those whose first experience was not entirely successful, for those who have a desire to understand the reasons and still achieve their cherished goal, as well as for those who have already successfully overcome marathon 42,195 m, but wants to improve his result and complete the \"royal\" distance easily and with joy.",
  "descriptionPartTwo": "Anyone can run a marathon! - quite often such a phrase is heard from coaches of running schools, from acquaintances who have already overcome the marathon distance and now collect hundreds of “likes” for their photos with medals on Instagram, from sellers in running equipment stores, from the pages of the “running” press.",
  "descriptionPartThree": "Yes, we can say that there is some truth in this statement, but there is also exactly the same amount of truth in statements such as: “Everyone can climb Everest”, “Anyone can swim across the Atlantic Ocean on a yacht”, “Run around the earth the ball on a bicycle is available to everyone.",
  "descriptionPartFour": "\nOf course, there are people who climbed Everest and sailed across the Atlantic on a yacht and cycled around the globe, but they all carefully PREPARED and TRAINED - these are the key words that helped them do it successfully and with joy.",
  "descriptionPartFive": "Agree that without developing a plan for realizing your dreams, organizing training, selecting equipment, and thorough preparation, your path, say, to Everest, will end pretty quickly? Is it true that in order to go on a yacht you need to understand navigation, learn how to sail? The truth is exactly that for a long bike trip you need to at least learn how to change tires or repair a broken chain.",
  "descriptionPartSix": "You need to prepare for a marathon, at least for the first, at least for the fiftieth. There are no shortcuts in this process. For thorough preparation, we advise you to break the whole process into “blocks” and carefully work them out as you approach the launch day."
